README for pcp_volume by pcppopper (da.box@home.se) (http://www.pcppopper.org/)
(find me in #winprog or #winprog.se on EFNet)

this module deals with windows volume controlling system. it is losely..em..loosely
based on v_bang.dll by blackhawk. i desided to do a rewrite of itsince i only have
32 megs of ram so every kb counts, (v_bang.dll = 22.016b, pcp_vol.dll = 5.632b).
(Note on the sizes: v_bang.dll is packed using the upx .exe packer which makes
it more than half the original size. pcp_vol.dll uses some compiler optimizations
to get it's small size. the .text and .reloc sections are merged with the .data
section which makes it a bit smaller.) blackhawk has later released a v_bang_lite
which is about 15.000b. Good job blackhawk =).

===============================================================================
Bangs:
===============================================================================

!Volume_Mute [line] - toggle sound. default line is 0 (Volume Control)
!Volume_Up [line] - louder. default line is 0 (Volume Control)
!Volume_Down [line] - softer. default line is 0 (Volume Control)
!Volume_Sound_On [line] - turn on sound. default line is 0 (Volume Control)
!Volume_Sound_Off [line] - turn off sound. default line is 0 (Volume Control)

===============================================================================
Variables:
===============================================================================

VolumeStepWidth <number>

sets the amount !Volume_Up/!Volume_Down increases/decreases the volume level
by.
Default is 6.

VolumeIgnoreBalance

is used as a boolean value to determine whether to adjust the volume with
respect to channel balance or not. If this is put in your .rc it means that
both the right and left channels will be equal.
Default is off.
(obviously, or it would have been called VolumeTakeBalanceIntoAccount or
something equally dumb).

Examples:

VolumeStepWidth 2
VolumeIgnoreBalance
*Hotkey Win+Z !Volume_Mute 0
*Hotkey Win+Up !Volume_Up 0
*Hotkey Win+Down !Volume_Down 0
*Hotkey Win+C !Volume_Sound_Off 0
*Hotkey Win+D !Volume_Sound_On 0

Updates:
===============================================================================

0.0:

Obviously nothing, (after all this was the first release).

0.1:

Fixed a bug that would wrap the volume if you went really quiet (beyond 0 that
is), darn DWORD's...can never trust them...thanks to Ryan Graffy for spotting
this. He also spotted a problem with the balance being thrown off at times.
I have only managed to reproduce this under one scenario. Go way low, i.e. 0,
and then rapidly increase the volume (hold down a hotkey combination for
raising the volume. The balance will be to the far left. This behavior is
completely inexplicable.
Fixed? an issue with crashing on quitModule. It has never crashed on my system,
but jesterace reported that it did on his. All i can see was that i wasn't
checking for NULL values before free():ing some variables, but that shouldn't
make quitModule go...haywire (heh...what a stupid word). Anyhow, if problems
persist in this updated version, please report them and if i can't spot any
bugs i'll be forced to release the source so others can have a go =).

0.2:

Rewrote most of the module making quite a lot of code more efficient and
generic. The size of the code was almost halved, but sadly msvc didn't really
adjust the compiled size accordingly =\. Managed to scale off 512 bytes, but
there is still a lot of stupid padding in the final .dll =\. Added the variable
VolumeIgnoreBalance. Adding it to your .rc makes pcp_vol ignore the current
balance between the left and right channels while adjusting it in !Volume_Up
and !Volume_Down. This can be very useful for people who have had problems with
the balance being thrown off at times. I promptly added it to my .rc, not
because i've been having problems with the balance but rather that i find
messing with the balance quite redundant and if something messes with it i can
easily reset it to centered with a quick !Volume_Up/!Volume_Down combo (i.e.
retaining the volume but making sure the balance is centered). Also fixed loads
of bugs in this README (had !Hotkey instead of *Hotkey..(i'm a dork)...also
changed the way a line is referred to from 'channel' to 'line' also fixed the
Jester? bug...it was supposed to be jesterace of course (sorry)).

0.3

Fixed a lot of bugs in this readme. Notoriously the v_bang bashing bug (sorry,
i didn't mean any harm.) and the bug that prevented channels to be specified
correctly.

0.4

Added !Volume_Sound_On and !Volume_Sound_Off. Someone requested this feature
so one can bind one key to turn off sound and another to turn it back on.
